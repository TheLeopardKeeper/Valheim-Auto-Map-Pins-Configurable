# Valheim-Auto-Map-Pins-Configurable

This mod automatically adds pins to the map.

Pins will be added within some range, they aren't saved, unless specified to do so, and will be automatically removed if you move to a different area.

as I learn the coding more I feel it would be nice to change how the config works in-game. more radio buttons or check boxes would be nice. better formatting would be nice as well.


Compatibility Issues:
May not be compatible with other mods that make changes to pins, such as PinFilters, Remove Death Pins, Locator, etc.
If your using the Compass mod you may have some FPS loss when adding a lot of pins to your map, since that mod also displays those pins on the compass as well.
